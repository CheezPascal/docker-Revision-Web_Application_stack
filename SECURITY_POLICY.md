SECURITY POLICY

Reporting Security Issues
-------------------------

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly. Avoid publicly disclosing vulnerabilities until they are fixed.

Best Practices
---------------

* Use strong credentials for MySQL (modify docker_run.sh as needed).

* Avoid exposing sensitive ports to public networks.

* Regularly update container images (docker pull mysql:latest, nginx:latest, node:latest).
